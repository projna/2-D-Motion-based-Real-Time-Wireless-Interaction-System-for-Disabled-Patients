# 2-D-Motion-based-Real-Time-Wireless-Interaction-System-for-Disabled-Patients

With the increasing number of disabled patients in
hospital, diversified needs of patients at certain times are to be
fulfilled. To provide with eminent healthcare and service, a full
time caretaker or 24 hour monitoring system may be needed,
requiring a huge amount of manpower and cost. In this paper
a low cost real time implementable system in hospital to establish
communication between multiple patients and nurse is proposed.
A small wireless transmitter consisting of Arduino Nano, NRF
24L01 and Accelerometer ADXL 335 is attached to a movable
body part of the patient working as message (8 messages) conveyer.
Device of every patient will be centrally linked to the
receiver point at nurseâ€™s end by wireless medium using SPI transmission.
The central receiver can convey the message from all
patients in a screen and trigger and alarm for notifying new message.
In case of distant wards from the central receiver (>40 m),
repeaters are used to convey the message to the central receiver.
Via this system the issue of 24 hour monitoring can be solved
with a very affordable cost and less manpower, improving healthcare
facilities and patient satisfaction in hospitals to manifold.
