Transmitter:
1) Setting the reference level of Arduino to 3.3V.
2) Declaring the input and output pins for NRF and Accelerometer.
3) Addressing the NRF module and setting it in.
4) Taking readings from the accelerometer.
5) Comparing the accelerometer reading with reference values for determining the position of accelerometer.
6) Transmitting one of the messages depending on the accelerometer position.

Receiver:
7) Declaring input and output pins for LCD monitor, NRF, GSM and Ethernet shield.
8) Setting up the NRF in listening mode.
9) If a message is received from transmitter, showing the message on the LCD display and turning on the buzzer for a certain period and setting a flag.
10) Sending the message through Ethernet shield and GSM.
11) Monitoring if another message has arrived from the transmitter
12) If push button is pressed, turning the flag to zero and turning the buzzer off.
13) If flag crosses a certain value, turning on the buzzer again.
